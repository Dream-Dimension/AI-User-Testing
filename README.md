# AI User Testing Tool
![Welcome](images/hero.jpeg)

Welcome to the AI User Testing Tool! This project is designed to help you get initial feedback on your designs using a simulated user powered by AI. It's perfect for a first pass before conducting real user testing, helping you refine the questions you want to ask and the feedback you need.

## Overview
The AI User Testing Tool simulates a user interacting with your designs and provides feedback based on a set of questions you create. This helps you familiarize yourself with the type of questions you might want to ask and the kind of feedback you can expect from real users.
